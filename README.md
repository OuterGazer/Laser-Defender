This game is based on the Laser Defender section of the GameDev.tv Unity 2D course.
My additions to the course example are:
- Different background and player/enemy sprites as well as SFXs
- Fade in/out of music tracks between level music and boss music
- Up to 6 different shooting patterns and 8 different enemy types. Simple animations are mine.
- A boss battle with 4 different scripted behaviours
- 3 power-ups: healing, missile shooting and fast shooting
- Ability to pause the game by pressing P

To play the game download the zip file, extract and double click on the executable. You need a resolution compatible with a 9:16 aspect ratio.

Alternatively, the game can be played at https://sharemygame.com/@OuterGazer/laser-defender, without worrying about the aspect ratio.
